# Publet

This is the user documentation for publet.

Publet is a small application that glues together three major players:

* [Scalate](http://scalate.fusesource.org/) which is a template engine
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and especially [JGit](http://www.jgit.org/)
* [Bootstrap]() for a great ui

Git is used as a repository system to back all sources that are feed into
the template engine to produce html pages. The default layout for those
pages is based on bootstrap.
