## What

Publet is a small application that glues together three major players:

* [Scalate](http://scalate.fusesource.org/) which is a template engine
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/) using the java implementation [JGit](http://www.jgit.org/)
* [Bootstrap]() for a great ui

Git is used as a repository system holding all sources that are fed into
the template engine to produce html pages. The default layout for those
pages is based on bootstrap. The templates and wiki pages can be edited
online or offline -- then using `git push` to deploy changes.

## Why
I like the wiki approach. It allows me to quickly edit a page and
add content. But that's not enough ;-) For small web sites, I'd also
like to add dynamic content as quickly as well.

What I found missing too often with other wikis is the ability to create
whatever html page I want. Often I'd like to create a very custom front
page but use wiki markup for all the text-heavy pages.

Then sometimes, there is need to integrate another app into existing
sites. For example, I once created a small app that let me manage my pdf files.
I could full text search all files upload them etc. I don't want to manage
a new war file for that. Besides, I'd like the pages of the new app to be
dressed up as my web sites. Since I couldn't find an existing application
that suited my needs, so I started with this one.

## Other Tools used

Publet uses a lot of other open source tools:

* [JQuery](http://jquery.com/) obvously!
* [JQuery File Upload plugin](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload)
* [Apache Shiro](http://shiro.apache.org/) for integrating Security needs
