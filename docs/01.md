Engines
-------

Engines are responsible for transforming content of one type into another
type.

The default engine maintains a set of converters which are functions that
transform content from one representation type into another. For example,
the default converter transforms markdown files into html.

Other converters may be registered, for example, to create pdf files of 
some content. Publet will try to find the best converter by searching
transitively and using the one with least intermediate conversions. That
way the converter engine can convert from multiple input formats into
multiple output formats.

Another option is to use the pamflet-based engine. This uses the pamflet
library to transform a whole source tree into html.
