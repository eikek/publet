engines
=======

The default engine is converter based and allows to register converter 
functions that transform content from one representation type into 
another. For example, the default converter transforms markdown files 
into html.

Other converters may be registered, for example, to create pdf files of 
some content. publet will try to find the best converter by searching 
transitively and using the one with least intermediate conversions.

Another option is to use the pamflet-based engine. This uses the pamflet 
library to transform a whole source tree into html.
