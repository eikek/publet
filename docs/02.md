sources 
=======

The default source is a directory on the local file system. You can
manage this using git or another scm. It is also possible to create
new sources by implementing the trait `Partition`.

publet will check if a source file has been changed and trigger the
transformation if necessary. Otherwise it delivers the output from a
cache.
