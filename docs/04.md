## how it works

The provided `ConverterEngine` comes with a converter that transforms `markdown` files
into `html` files by using the [knockoff](http://tristanjuricek.com/knockoff/) library.
That creates a chunk of html ready to display. To create a complete page, however, some
parts like header and footer are missing. This is accomplished by template-engines that
are wrapped around the `ConverterEngine`.

The `YamlEngine` is such a template engine that makes use of the [yaml css
framework](http://www.yaml.de). So the engine that gets registered is created like
that

```scala
import org.eknet.publet.engine._
import org.eknet.publet.ContentType._

val publet = Publet()
val conv = ConverterEngine()
conv.addConverter(markdown -> html, KnockoffConverter)
publet.register("/*", new YamlEngine('default, conv))
```

The `YamlEngine` also adds a syntax highlighter [highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/)
that pretty-prints all `<pre><code>` sections automatically.
