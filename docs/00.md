publet
======

*publet* is a simple publishing engine written in scala.


publet consists of two components and a set of conventions. A
_partition_ contains source files, like `markdown` or `html` files. The _engine_
is transforming the contents of a source file into some target format. There may
be many partitions and engines. The convention is, that a files with the same
name have equal contents - but in different format. And the format of a file
is recognized by its extension.

A file on a partition is represented by a `path` which is a dash `/` delimited
list of names. The last segment in this path is the file name. Publet lets you
mount partitions to a path prefix and engines are registerd to path patterns. Then
publet can figure out the resource and engine to use by specifying the path to that
resource. The target format is extracted from the requested path.

For example, the requested path is `/some/path/to/a/file.html`. This tells publet
"give me the contents of `file` in html format, please". So a `html` file is requestd.
Publet looks at the directory `/some/path/to/a` for files with the name `file`
and an arbitary extension. The collected set of existing resources are then fed into
the engine together with the content type `html`. The engine then can chose its prefered
source format and produces html output of the given source file. If the exact file is
found, it is returned without consulting any engine.
