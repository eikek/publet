publet
======

*publet* is an extensible wiki application and git repository manager.

publet is at first a simple web server. There is a git repository with
resources that are served by publet. publet is more clever than a normal
web server in that it can convert resources from one format to another.
For example, it converts markdown to html. With that and an online
editor for the resources, publet is yet another wiki application with
markdown as its wiki syntax.
